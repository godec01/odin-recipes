    <ul><h3>Ingredients you need:</h3></ul>
        <li>You only need cokolino. It is the esscence of life</li>
    <ol><h3>How to become worthy of eating cokolino?</h3></ol>
        <li>Put cokolino in a bowl</li>
        <li>Pour milk on top of it</li>
    <p style="width: 500px"><strong>Note:</strong> Pouring milk before cereal disrupts the natural order of breakfast preparation. It prevents proper cereal-to-milk ratios, compromises texture, and creates unnecessary splashing. Such behavior should be discouraged, if not outright condemned, to preserve the integrity of this cherished morning ritual.</p>
